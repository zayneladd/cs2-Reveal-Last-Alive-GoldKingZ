Welcome to the **Reveal Last Player Alive** plugin for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). This plugin enhances gameplay by revealing the last player alive using glow effects or a chicken indicator. Perfect for those who want to add a strategic twist to their gaming sessions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Last Player Reveal**: Automatically highlights the last player alive.
- **Glow Effects**: Use glowing indicators to make the last player stand out.
- **Chicken Indicator**: A fun alternative that uses a chicken to show the last player.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust glow colors and effects to fit your gameplay style.

## 📦 Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/zayneladd/cs2-Reveal-Last-Alive-GoldKingZ/releases). Once downloaded, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
2. **Copy the Plugin**: Move the plugin file to your CS2 plugins directory.
3. **Restart the Server**: Ensure the server is restarted to load the new plugin.

## ⚙️ Configuration
